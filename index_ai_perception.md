      <strong>AI Perception for Workplace Safety:</strong> Implemented comprehensive computer vision system for person detection and PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) compliance monitoring, deployed on autonomous mobile platform for workplace safety surveillance and risk compliance enforcement.
      <br><br>
      <strong>Computer Vision Architecture:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Person Detection:</strong> Real-time human detection and tracking in industrial environments</li>
        <li><strong>PPE Detection:</strong> Automated identification of safety equipment usage (helmets, vests, gloves)</li>
        <li><strong>Compliance Monitoring:</strong> Risk assessment and safety protocol enforcement</li>
        <li><strong>Cognitive Surveillance:</strong> Intelligent behavior analysis for workplace safety</li>
      </ul>
      
      <strong>AI Integration:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Edge AI Processing:</strong> Real-time inference on mobile platform</li>
        <li><strong>Multi-camera Fusion:</strong> Stereo and mono camera integration for robust detection</li>
        <li><strong>Autonomous Patrol:</strong> Mobile platform navigation with AI perception overlay</li>
        <li><strong>Alert Systems:</strong> Real-time safety violation reporting and documentation</li>
      </ul>
      
      <strong>Innovation:</strong> First autonomous mobile safety surveillance system combining AI perception with mobile robotics for workplace risk compliance monitoring. This project also had significance in system architecture where hardware integration was developed, and in motion planning where autonomous navigation was implemented.
